## EscapeFromMaldenMOD.Malden  
This mission is based on the original "Escape from Malden" mission.

WIP, work but many things need to be redone the right way.  
  
My main idea is to allow me and a group of friends to really enjoy this mission.  
To be honest, I didn't keep track of codes coming from internet and I am pretty sure some stuff may need some credits.  
  
What's done so far (missing some for sure):
```
- Additional options on mission selection:
	- Better equipment (ENVG-II, Nightstalker, GPS for everyone).
	- Increased enemy count (Add a tower to each city, allow vehicle spawn 2 units).
	- Custom Escape rules: Original or Permissive (don't loss if everyone is dead, initial respawn trigger remain).
	- Additional objectives.

- Regarding the original stuff (little modifications/full rework).
	- Win condition: original had a glitch where you can in some case win if a unit is in a helicopter and its destroyed.
	- Enemy patrol spawn: any spawned group (not including vehicle patrol) are killed if all players distance > 1.8km, recreate trigger when this happen.
	- Empty group cleanup script: now work, original can't.
	- Populate city/triggers: condition now work fine (regarding distances), every spawning stuff moved to associate script, player warned when approaching city/checkpoint.
	- Special events: mortar disabled.
	- Removed Tanoa specific stuff.

- Added:
	- Additional objectives (not need to complete the escape mission): Eliminate unit (x2), Clean checkpoint (x3), Explore old base (x2), Collect intel (x2), Power station sabotage (x1).
	- Added Special events: 
		- Orca CAS (ported from Escape from Tanoa)
		- Huron landing, paradrop is no suitable position found (can glitch a bit, work for most).
	- FIA friendly patrols that stalk enemy patrols.
	- AA soldiers added to each patrol (NATO/FIA).
	- Player group added units: Missile Specialist (AA), Missile Specialist (AC), Heavy Gunner.
	- If better equipment option selected: Allow player to respawn with their previous equipment, icon on previous corpse, icon on incapacitated friendly.
	- Random position for original checkpoint: the one near airport don't move, the others have 2/3 positions possible.
	- Two additional big checkpoints around "Le Port" and one near Goisse (depend on optional objectives).
	- A military base on South West corner: possible escape position.
	- Power station in "La Rivi√®re" (depend on optional objectives).
	- "Random" initial respawn position.
	- End mission statistics tab: 
		- For each player: Fire shots (bullet, HE, smoke, rocket, vehicle), distance travelled (foot, vehicle), longest kill (incl weapon name), friendly kills.
		- For group: cumulative fire shots (bullet, HE, smoke, rocket ,vehicle), longest kill (incl player name), friendly kills (incl player name).

- Specific stuff:
	- If optional objectives enabled: All checkpoint markers are hidden.
	- Regarding Intel mission(s):
		- Some intel collected reveal checkpoint markers, another create a CSAT squad rescue objective that lead to the group following your team and possibility to meet a Sniper team if success.
		- Whiteboard on-site to draw on, yes super fancy, work only locally, mouse left button to draw.
	- Regarding Power Station sabotage mission:
		- Shutdown all light on the island.
		- Highly reduce AI ability to spot your team in cities/base/airport, do not affect recon/sniper squad.
	- When respawn, player is teleported in a radius of 50m to limit risk of successive die if stuck in a ambush.
	
- What still need to be done:
	- Increase overall performance.
	- Disable if possible the noise effect when end of mission occurs (not sure it is possible).
	- You tell me :P
