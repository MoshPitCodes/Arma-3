This folder contain useful data extracted from the game archives, untouched except of bin to cpp conversion.  
While functions files are not really here to provide any wiki kind of help, its can still be useful for some scripters to understand how undocumented vanilla functions work (BIS, please be kind with me).  
  
Notes:  
- No unbinarized version of any 3D model will be ever uploaded on this repository.  
- Functions folder isn't organized, it contain all functions incl. main and missions specifics.  
  
Without any other notice, all data into this folder are from Bohemia Interactive and may be under copyright infringement, even if widely used by the community.
